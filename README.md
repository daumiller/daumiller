## Behold! ... My stuff. ##

*You probably won't find anything especially useful here.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Things I'm very interested in:**
- languages
  - C, ASM, Verilog
  - Objective-C, Ruby
  - JavaScript, TypeScript
- embedded systems, Z80/6502, ATMEGA μcs, ARM64
- graphics rasterization, windowing/gui toolkits
- compilers & new languages
- mechanical keyboards
- speech synthesis
- software customization through programmability/scripting

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Things I despise:**
- Garbage Collectors
- The C language standard (trash document is a detriment to the living language)
- The FHS (ruins fs organization, and encourages hard-coding paths (they're everywhere, even in the kernel!))
- modern C++
- glibc, glib
- vi & emacs
