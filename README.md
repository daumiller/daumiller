## 📖 Repositories

Welcome to my source dump, where projects that I've lost interest in (dedicating the vanishingly small amount of free time that I have to) come to await my retirement.

There are a handful of libraries here that were wrote for external use; but they're scattered among many prototype applications that are definitely not of distribution/general-use quality.

## ⭐️ Interests

There are so many projects that I wish I had the time to work on; but I'm currently most interested in working on simple systems. -- Simple as in not convoluted messes of spaghetti, protoduction, and bloat; but easy to understand components, with unambiguous impelmentations and interworking. The kinds of things too rarely seen in commercial development (or in many of my side projects 😅).

Some more specific things I enjoy working on:
- processors (basic designs, soft-core/fpga)
- SBCs for 8/16/early 32 bit systems (Z80/6502/65816/M68K)
- MCU boards (building AVR; using AVR/ARM)
- mechanical keyboards (everything except interfacing USB 🙄)
- programming languages (❤️ languages!)
- operating systems & their APIs (a: linux-kernel based, b: non-POSIX)
- GFX/GUI/Widget toolkits ⚙️ (I've started waaay too many of these)
- RAD IDEs (👈 peak productivity here)
- CAD design & 3D printing
- vanilla JS (and other simplifactions of convoluted web stacks)

Some itches I've yet to fully scratch:
- speech synthesis (physically modelled)
- compression (I've got this idea 😆)
- text/hex editors
- HTML alternatives (ex: Gemini/Spartan/Gopher)

Some things that get me ranting:
- corporatization of the internet 💰
- the C language standard
- the FHS, LSB, and POSIX in general
- glibc and glib
- planned/forced obsolescence
- bloat keeping pace with (or being required by) hardware advances
